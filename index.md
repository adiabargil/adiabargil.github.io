# Welcome to My Personal Website

## About Me

I’m **Adi Abargil**, a Robotics and AI researcher currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Computer Science at the **Technion – Israel Institute of Technology**. My academic focus lies in multi-robot coordination, perception, and uncertainty modeling, particularly in collaborative environments where robots operate with heterogeneous sensors and must share perceptual information.

I am currently working on designing probabilistic models that help robotic agents estimate and fuse object poses across coordinate frames under uncertainty. In such systems, each robot operates in its own local frame, and transforming data between these frames—especially when dealing with physical misalignments, calibration drift, or dynamic environments—is a significant challenge. My work explores how to mitigate the accumulation of transformation errors using tools from state estimation, kinematics, and probabilistic inference, ultimately aiming to improve the reliability and precision of cooperative robotic manipulation.

Alongside my academic path, I bring several years of industry experience. I worked at **Ricor Cryogenic & Vacuum Systems** as a Product Manager and Customer Engineer, managing complex technical integrations and aligning engineering efforts with customer needs. Prior to that, at **Applied Materials**, I served in both global and local engineering roles, including a position in South Korea where I supported system integration in a fast-paced, multicultural setting.

Beyond my professional work, I have a deep commitment to social impact and volunteerism. I’ve held leadership positions—most notably as chairman of the student union during my undergraduate years—and continue to give back through organizations like **ISEF**, **Paamonim**, and **PERACH**, while also serving as a volunteer in a front-line IDF reserve unit.

But there’s more to me than robotics and code. I live in **Yoqneam Illit** with my wife, **Noam Abargil**, and our energetic dog **Julie**. In my personal time, I’m all about pushing limits—whether it’s wakeboarding, snowboarding, off-road motorcycle riding, or any activity that gets my heart racing. I’m also a tech enthusiast and early adopter, constantly reading and listening to tech news (yes, I listen to at least one podcast a day).

And when I say I love building things—I mean it. I’ve taken the DIY spirit to the extreme by literally **building and constructing my own home from the ground up**. It’s one of my proudest achievements and reflects how much I enjoy creating with my hands, not just my mind.

This site is where all my worlds come together—research, projects, and personal passions. Whether you're an academic, a tech geek, a potential collaborator, or just someone curious, I’m always open to meaningful connections and shared ideas.
