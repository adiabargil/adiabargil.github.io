                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm <strong>Adi Abargil</strong>, a Robotics and AI researcher currently pursuing an M.Sc. through the TASP program (Technion Autonomous Systems Program) 
                    at the <strong>Technion</strong> – Israel Institute of Technology. As part of the program, I conduct my research at the <strong>Faculty of Computer Science</strong> 
                    in the <strong>CLAIR Lab</strong>, supervised by Prof. Sarah Keren, Head of CLAIR lab, focusing on robotics and artificial intelligence.</p>

            <section id="academic">
                <h3>Academic Research</h3>
                <p>My academic focus lies in multi-robot coordination, perception, and uncertainty modeling, particularly in collaborative environments where robots operate with 
                    heterogeneous sensors and must share perceptual information.</p>

                <p>I am currently working on designing probabilistic models that help robotic agents estimate and fuse object poses across coordinate frames under uncertainty. 
                    In such systems, each robot operates in its own local frame, and transforming data between these frames, especially when dealing with physical misalignments, calibration drift, 
                    or dynamic environments, is a significant challenge. My work explores how to mitigate the accumulation of transformation errors using tools from state estimation, kinematics, 
                    and probabilistic inference, ultimately aiming to improve the reliability and precision of cooperative robotic manipulation.</p>

            <section id="professional">
                <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
                <p>Alongside my academic path, I bring several years of industry experience. I worked at <strong>Ricor</strong> Cryogenic & Vacuum Systems as a Product Manager and Customer Engineer, 
                    managing complex technical integrations and aligning engineering efforts with customer needs. Prior to that, at <strong>Applied Materials</strong>, I filled both global and local 
                    engineering roles, including a relocation position in South Korea, where I supported the local teams and customers in a fast-paced, multicultural setting.</p>

            <section id="volunteering">
                <h3>Volunteerism & Social Impact</h3>
                <p>Beyond my professional work, I have a deep commitment to social impact and volunteerism. I've held leadership positions, most notably as chairman of the 
                    student union during my undergraduate years. Nowadays, I'm continuing to give back through organizations like <strong>ISEF</strong>, <strong>Paamonim</strong>, 
                    and <strong>PERACH</strong>, while also volunteering for reserve duty in a front-line unit of <strong>IDF</strong>.</p>

            <section id="personal">
                <h3>Personal Life</h3>
                <p>But there's more to me than robotics and code. I live in Yoqneam Illit with my wife, Noam Abargil, and our energetic 
                    dog Julie. In my personal time, I'm all about pushing limits—whether it's wakeboarding, snowboarding, off-road motorcycle riding, or 
                    any activity that gets my heart racing. I'm also a tech enthusiast and early adopter, constantly reading and listening to tech news (yes, I listen to at least one podcast a day).</p>

                <p>And when I say I love building things, I mean it. I've taken the DIY spirit to the extreme by literally building and constructing my own home from 
                    the ground up. It's one of my proudest achievements and reflects how much I enjoy creating with my hands, not just my mind.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="closing">
                <p>This site is where all my worlds come together—research, projects, and personal passions. Whether you're an academic, a tech geek, a potential collaborator, 
                    or just someone curious, I'm always open to meaningful connections and shared ideas.</p>
